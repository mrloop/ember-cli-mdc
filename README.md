Installation
------------
    
You install this add-on by installing individual packages that contain needed components
and/or resources.

    ember install ember-cli-[package-name]@^2.0.0

Ex.    
    
    ember install ember-cli-mdc-form@^2.0.0
    ember install ember-cli-mdc-button@^2.0.0
    ember install ember-cli-mdc-dialog@^2.0.0
    
See the [packages directory](https://github.com/onehilltech/ember-cli-mdc/tree/master/packages) for a 
list of packages that can be installed individually.

> `ember-cli-mdc` has its own integration for the sass compiler, and is not compatible with
> `ember-cli-sass`. If you have `ember-cli-sass` installed, then you must first uninstall 
> `ember-cli-sass` for your `ember-cli-mdc` application to build correctly.
